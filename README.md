# PackerSample

A example of how to modify specific data inside exe file (non-resource data, but struct variables)

### Quick test
1. Compile in Debug configuration
2. Run target.exe and see what's written
3. Run Packer.exe
4. Run target.exe again and see that the text has changed

### TODO/FIX
Packer has at least one bug tat might happen when exe is over 1MB. See code for description
